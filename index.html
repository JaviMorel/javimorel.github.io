										<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
										<p>I studied Computer Engineering in the University of Murcia, Spain. After that, I decided to dedicate my career to be a Game Programmer and I started the Master's Degree in Video Game Development, specialization in Programming in the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain. </p>

										<p>Since that, I have been learning and creating games in groups or alone to prove what can I do. In this portfolio there are some examples of games which I have done along this time. My main interests are Gameplay and AI. I love creating the feel of a game, making specifics mechanics which could make the game unique.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Skills</h2>
										<p>I have experience in creating games on Unity and Unreal Engine 4, using C# and C++ as the programming language. Furthermore, I made a course by <a href="https://www.gamedev.tv/courses">Game Dev</a> called "Unreal Multiplayer Master: Video Game Dev In C++ Course" and there I learned how to create an online game on UE4 by C++.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Final Grade Project-Genetic Algorithm for making sports schedules in Round Robin tournaments</h2>
										<p>As the final grade project, I did an investigation on genetic algorithms and I created one which generates sports schedules in Round Robin tournaments (like a football league system) with restrictions. Moreover, I made an application on Unity (with C#) to show an usage example of this algorithm.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Game Projects</h2>
									<p>Since I started learning programming, I have participated in different game projects which had been uploaded to Itch.io. Some of them, I made them alone but, however, I have created others in groups.</p>

											<a href="https://javimorel.itch.io/trading-paradise" class="image"><img src="images/tradingparadise.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Trading Paradise</h3>
											<p>Trading Paradise is a puzzle game in which you have to trade items to reach a goal item. This game was made on Unity with C# and it has two game modes, an one player mode and a two players mode.</p>

											<p>I made this game alone, including the art part, the design of the game and the programming part. The game logic of this game always provide, at least, a way to reach the goal and, depending of the difficulty, the number of trades that you have to make changes.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Daedalus Stargazer</h3>
											<p>This game was made on Unreal Engine with C++ for the GlobalGameJam2021. This game is about to obtain a number of items making dash to the rhythm of the music.</p>
											<p>I participated in this Game Jam with a team and I was responsible for making the movement of the player and the game functionality.</p>

											<a href="https://javimorel.itch.io/fujiori" class="image"><img src="images/fujiori.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Fujiori</h3>
											<p>This game was made on Unreal Engine with C++ for the EpicMegaJam2020. It is about to climb down a mountain avoiding obstacles and the difficulty of the game changes to the rythm of the music.</p>
											<p>In this Game Jam, I have also participated with a team and I was the gameplay programmer. I made the character movement of one of the game modes, the lose and win mechanisms and the powerups effects.</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="https://jlga10.itch.io/sweet-alliance" class="image"><img src="images/sweetalliance.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Sweet Alliance</h3>
											<p>This game was made for the Global StartupCities GameJam on Unity with C#. Sweet Alliance is a local multiplayer cooperative game where you have to protect your base from the enemies. However, it will not be easy because each player controls the movement of their character and the gunshot of the other. 
											</p>
											<p>I made this game with a team and I was responsible for the enemies spawn, the lose condition and some powerups effects.</p>

										<article>
											<a href="https://hobbitct.itch.io/switch-on" class="image"><img src="images/switchon.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Switch On</h3>
											<p>This game was developed for the Futuristic Jam 2020 on Unity with C#. Switch On is a game where will have to restore your sight and get out of the place without being seen by the enemies. </p>
											<p>This was the first Game Jam which I had participated and I did it with a team. I was responsible for the enemies' behaviour, the streaming levels and the mechanism of the doors.</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="https://javimorel.itch.io/war-bot" class="image"><img src="images/warbot.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">War bot</h3>
											<p>War bot is a game to create a war between the players (max 30 names) and this game was created to recreate the famous Twitter bots that were created in 2018 which did the same thing.</p>
											<p>I made this game alone on Unity with C# and it was made for PC and Android mobiles. This game has an interesting logic game. If a player defeates a lot of players, they will have more possibilities to win the next fight, but they are not invincibles. </p>

											<a href="https://javimorel.itch.io/the-hunting-of-the-bones" class="image"><img src="images/Thehunting.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">The hunting of the bones</h3>
											<p>This was my first game and I made it for a subject in my degree of Computer Engineering on Unity with C#. I made the whole game alone, including the 3D models and animations. In this game, your purpose is to take all the bones around the house without being seen by the cats. The behaviour of the cats (the enemies) are simple and some objects around the map change depending of the number of bones that you have.</p>

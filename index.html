										<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
										<p>I studied Computer Engineering in the University of Murcia, Spain. After that, I decided to dedicate my career to be a Game Programmer and I started the Master's Degree in Video Game Development, specialization in Programming in the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain. </p>

										<p>Since that, I have been learning and creating games in groups or alone to prove what can I do. In this portfolio there are some examples of games which I have done along this time. My main interests are Gameplay and AI. I love creating the feel of a game, making specifics mechanics which could make the game unique.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Skills</h2>
										<p>I have experience in creating games on Unity and Unreal Engine 4, using C# and C++ as the programming language. Furthermore, I made a course by <a href="https://www.gamedev.tv/courses">Game Dev</a> called "Unreal Multiplayer Master: Video Game Dev In C++ Course" and there I learned how to create an online game on UE4 by C++.</p>

										<p>As the final grade project, I did an investigation on genetic algorithms and I created one which generates sports schedules in Round Robin tournaments (like a football league system) with restrictions. Moreover, I made an application on Unity (with C#) to show an usage example of this algorithm.</p>

											<p>Whispers is a scary adventure set in the witch-hunting days when not long ago the last member of your family, your older sister, was burned at the stake for witchcraft.You are certain she was sentenced unjustly, as the only warlock in your family is you.For that reason, you had to run away from your village to the forest nearby and now you are completely alone, except for the whispers: they have always been with you. You didn’t use to pay much attention to them, but now they´ve become more insistent, calling and telling you they’re your only chance of survival.</p>

											<p>I made this game with a team project of  more than 20 people from the Master’s Degree for the PlayStation Talents. This game was made on Unreal Engine 4. The gameplay of this game is about events and I made most of them plus a game manager which sets the correct state of each event. Moreover, I was responsible for the character movement, the AI behaviors and the settings menu functionality. </p>
